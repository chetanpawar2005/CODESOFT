## Overview

Welcome to my internship project repository at CodeSoft! During my internship, I completed two main tasks:

1. ATM Interface
2. Guess the Number Game

This README file provides an overview of each task, how to set up and run the programs, and additional details necessary for understanding and using the applications.

## Tasks

### 1. ATM Interface

The ATM Interface is a console-based Java application that simulates basic ATM functionalities. Users can perform the following operations:

- Check Balance
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Exit

#### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codesoft-internship.git
    cd codesoft-internship
    ```

2. Navigate to the `atm-interface` directory:
    ```sh
    cd atm-interface
    ```

3. Compile the Java program:
    ```sh
    javac Atm_Interface.java
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```sh
    java Atm_Interface
    ```

#### Features

- **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance of the user.
- **Deposit Money**: Allows the user to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account.
- **Exit**: Exits the application.

### 2. Guess the Number Game

The Guess the Number Game is an interactive console-based Java game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

#### How to Run

1. Navigate to the `guess-the-number` directory:
    ```sh
    cd guess-the-number
    ```

2. Compile the Java program:
    ```sh
    javac Number_game.java
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```sh
    java Number_game
    ```

#### Features

- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- Feedback is provided for each guess (too high, too low).
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- The number of attempts is displayed at the end.

## Setup Requirements
